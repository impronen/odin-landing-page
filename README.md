# The Odin Project Landing page project

This is me creating my first landing page from scratch.

### What is it about

This project is an assignment in The Odin Project. The [overall design](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png) of the page was provided and I copied it to the best of my ability. The goal was to create something without any ready made content provided.

### What I learned

- Using Flexbox to position elements on a page. Especially how to use nested elements to create varied but consistent look.
- Practicing how to simplify my design - making the design more streamlined
- Getting comfortable with GIT and GITHUB - especially how important it is to commit often and try to wirte descriptive and concice commit logs
- Effectively using Inspect on Chrome to see my code in action
- Patience
